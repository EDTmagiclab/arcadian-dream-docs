# Ritual Crafting

Ritual crafting is a new way to craft items in the world. It is a bit more complicated than normal crafting, but it allows for more complex recipes.

Ritual crafting is done by placing down a **Ritual Shrine** surrounded by as many **Onbashira** blocks as you need. The Onbashira blocks must be placed in a specific pattern, and the Ritual Shrine must be placed in the center of the pattern.

The outer circle must be placed one block higher than the inner circle. The bottom blocks of the outer circle don't matter.

Ingredients are placed on the Onbashiras, and the recipe is activated by pressing USE on the Ritual Shrine.
